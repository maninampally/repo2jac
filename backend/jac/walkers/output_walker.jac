        You are writing a professional README.md for a Jac/Jaseci project
        that was automatically converted from a Python repository.

        HARD REQUIREMENTS:
        - Output MUST be valid GitHub-flavored Markdown.
        - Use clear headings, sub-headings, bullet lists, and tables.
        - Do NOT include placeholder text like "TBD" or "lorem ipsum".
        - Stay under ~250 lines.

        INPUT:
        - repo_name: name of the original repo
        - file_summaries: list of {path, role, confidence, validated}
        - avg_confidence: float 0–1
        - review_needed: list of file paths needing manual review

        STRUCTURE THE README EXACTLY LIKE THIS:

        # <Project Title>  (use repo_name, formatted nicely)

        > One-line description explaining this is a Jac/Jaseci conversion agent output.

        ## Overview
        - Brief description of what the original repo does.
        - Brief description of what this Jac version provides.
        - Mention that files were converted automatically and include a confidence note
          like: "Average conversion confidence: XX%".

        ## OSP Design Decisions
        Explain why classes/functions became **nodes** vs **walkers**:
        - **Nodes**: 1–3 bullets (what state they hold, examples from file_summaries).
        - **Walkers**: 1–3 bullets (what workflows they represent).
        - **Edges**: 1–2 bullets describing main graph relationships.

        ## File Structure

        Use a fenced code block with a tree, THEN a table:

        ```text
        <folder and .jac file tree here>
        ```

        | File | Role | Confidence | Validated |
        |------|------|------------|-----------|
        | <path> | <role> | <confidence as %> | ✅ / ⚠ |

        Only include .jac files in the table. Use emojis for Validated
        if helpful (✅ for validated True, ⚠ for False).

        ## Setup

        ### Prerequisites
        - Python >= 3.8
        - Jaseci runtime (`pip install jaseci`)
        - (Optional) Any other dependencies you detect from roles.

        ### Installation

        ```bash
        pip install jaseci
        # If there is a requirements.txt or extra deps, show them here
        ```

        ## Quick Demo Walkthrough

        1. How to run the main Jac entrypoint (e.g. `jac run main.jac`).
        2. What the user should expect to see in the terminal.
        3. Where generated files or ZIPs will appear.

        ## Files Needing Manual Review

        - If review_needed is empty:
          - Write one sentence saying no files are flagged for manual review.
        - If there are files:
          - Add a bullet list of paths.
          - Briefly explain what to check (logic, types, edges, etc.).

        ## Tech Stack

        Use a small Markdown table:

        | Layer | Technology |
        |-------|-----------|
        | Agent Orchestration | Jac walkers (Analyzer, Planner, Converter, Output) |
        | Graph Model | Jac nodes (Repo, File, Plan, Output) |
        | LLM | byLLM (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |
        | Runtime | Jaseci CLI (`jac`) |

        ## Conversion Notes

        - Summarize how the agent analyzed, planned, converted, and assembled the repo.
        - Mention that the code was generated by an agentic pipeline (Analyzer → Planner → Converter → Output).
        - Remind users to run tests and review flagged files before production.

        ## License

        - If the original repo likely had a license file, mention that this project
          should respect the same license and that users must verify it.

        Return ONLY the Markdown README content. No extra commentary.
