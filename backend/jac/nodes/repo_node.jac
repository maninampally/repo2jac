#
# WHAT IT IS:
#   Represents the entire GitHub repository being converted.
#   This is the ROOT node — the starting point of the graph.
#   Every FileNode, PlanNode, and OutputNode connects back to this.
#
# HOW IT FITS:
#   RepoNode
#     ├── [contains] → FileNode (one per .py file)
#     ├── [has_plan] → PlanNode (the OSP mapping plan)
#     └── [produces] → OutputNode (final ZIP output)
#
# USED BY:
#   - PlannerWalker  (reads repo name + all files)
#   - ConverterWalker (entry point, starts the conversion loop)
#   - OutputWalker   (assembles final output)
